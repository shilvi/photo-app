Shilvi Satpati

Q: What corrections did you have to make?

   2. Contrast Errors
   Ignored:
   1. Empty Button for all the buttons that don't do anythin yet
   2. Possible heading alert for the like counter


Q: Given that the photos and captions rely on user-generated content,
   do you think that the accessibility problems are all solvable? Why
   or why not?
A: I don't think that all the accessibility problems are solvable.
   Since the website is mainly an image sharing site, it would almost
   always be impossible to get the context from a description of the
   image.


Q: Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or
   why not?
A: I think that my website is still usable after turning off CSS. The
   relative order of all the elements is preserved and its easy to
   discern all the different details.


Q: Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the images? Why
   or why not?
A: My website layout is still techincally usable after turning off
   images. The images get repalced by the alt-text, which is descriptive
   enough to use. But since this is an image sharing site, I don't think
   it would serve its purpose.
