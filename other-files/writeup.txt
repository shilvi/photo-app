Accessibility Reflection
Shilvi Satpati

Q: What resources did you consult as you implemented the accessibility features?
   Were there any that you found useful that aren’t on the Accessibility Resources page?
A: Resources Used:
   1. What the Heck is ARIA? A Beginner’s Guide to ARIA for Accessibility
   2. ARIA Roles and Attributes: How to Actually Use Them
   There were no other resources that I used for implementing the accessibility features.


Q: Reflect on the work that went into making your website accessible.
   Q: Was it a lot of additional work?
   A: No, I didn't do too much additional work, since I was making sure that whenever
      I created a button, I assigned the accessibility tags as well.
   Q: What was the most challenging part?
   A: The most challenging part was to get the focussing on modal opening correctly.
      I had to write javascript to ensure that the correct elements get focus.
   Q: Do you think that designing for accessibility also improves the usability of the
      site for all users? Why or why not?
   A: Yes, I think designing for accessibility can improve the usability for all users.
      When designing for accessibility, it forces the developer to keep the interactions
      in a consistant manner, which is useful even for normal users.


Extra Credit:
Make the "Escape" key close the modal (in addition to the close button),
and make sure the focus still returns to the "View all X comments" button.
